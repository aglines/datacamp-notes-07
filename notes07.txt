notes taken both here and paper sheets

Summary stats . a fact abt the data
Descriptive, Inferential types of stats
Data types - numeric - continuous, discrete
    Categorical, ordinal or nominal

Measures of Center - ways to describe a 'typical' value in a dt set
MEAN
    'average' - add all pts, divide by nubmer of pts
np.mean(dframe['colName'])

MEDIAN
    50% of data is higher, 50% lower
np.median(dframe['colName'])    

MODE    most frequent value taht appears in data
    often used for CATEGORICAL vars, theyre not numeric

statistics.mode(dframe['colName'])

How know which to use? check OUTLIERS.
dframe[dframe['colName'] == "specificType"]['valueOfInterest'].agg([np.mean, npmedian])
with an outlier,
Mean is sensitive to extreme values, Median not as much
Symmetric data = use mean
Skewed or asymmetric, use median

Left-Skewed data - the TAIL is on the LEFT.  ditto R
