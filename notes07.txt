Summary stats . a fact abt the data
Descriptive, Inferential types of stats
Data types - numeric - continuous, discrete
    Categorical, ordinal or nominal

Measures of Center - ways to describe a 'typical' value in a dt set
MEAN
    'average' - add all pts, divide by nubmer of pts
np.mean(dframe['colName'])

MEDIAN
    50% of data is higher, 50% lower
np.median(dframe['colName'])    

MODE    most frequent value taht appears in data
    often used for CATEGORICAL vars, theyre not numeric

statistics.mode(dframe['colName'])

How know which to use? check OUTLIERS.
dframe[dframe['colName'] == "specificType"]['valueOfInterest'].agg([np.mean, npmedian])
with an outlier,
Mean is sensitive to extreme values, Median not as much
Symmetric data = use mean
Skewed or asymmetric, use median

Left-Skewed data - the TAIL is on the LEFT.  ditto R

########## MEASURES OF SPREAD   
VARIANCE
    sum of squares of each dt pts distance from mean, dvd by # dt pts - 1
        units are squared remember
np.var(dframe['colName'], ddof=1)
    DEGREES OF FREEDOM make sure to use 1 here, else it uses a SAMPLE variance,
        best for large pops, which .. not yet

STD DEV
    sqrt of the variance
np.std(dframe['colName'], ddof=1)
    units are NOT squared so they are more intuitive to understand

MEAN ABSOLUTE DEVIATION
    takes abs val of dist to mean, then takes the mean of that
    penalizes each distance equally, while stdev penalizes larger ones more than small

QUANTILES   break up data into some number of equal parts
np.quantile(dframe['col'], 0.25)
np.quantile(dframe['col'], [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1])
    returns X, ie. 0%, 25%, 50%... of values in dataset are less than X-returned value
    50% quantile IS the median, ie half the values are lower than this value
    BOX PLOTS use quartiles, four-divided

QUANTILES w NP.LINSPACE
    np.linspace(start, stop, num)
        start number, stop number, number of intervals
np.quantile(dframe['colName'], np.linspace(0,1,5) )
    these would be quartiles, since theyre from 0 to 100% and 5 diff interval pt

IQR interquartile range, ie height of a box plot, 
    the numb of vals btwn 25th and 75th quantile,
        can get from the diff of those, or 
    from scipy.stats import iqr,
iqr(dframe['colName'])

OUTLIERS are dt pt v diff fr others. but HOW diff? one rule - 
any dt pt < Q1 - 1.5x IQR, or > Q3 + 1.5x IQR
can calc by hand yay!  

.DESCRIBE method gfives us ltos of these incl quartiles
